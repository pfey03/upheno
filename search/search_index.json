There are a few different editors workflows: Local editing workflow: Editing the ontology in your local environment by hand, using tools such as Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, ROBOT templates or DOSDP patterns. Completely automated data pipeline (GitHub Actions) DROID workflow This document only covers the first editing workflow, but more will be added in the future Local editing workflow Workflow requirements: - git - github - docker - editing tool of choice, e.g. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, your favourite text editor, etc 1. Create issue Ensure that there is a ticket on your issue tracker that describes the change you are about to make. While this seems optional, this is a very important part of the social contract of building an ontology - no change to the ontology should be performed without a good ticket, describing the motivation and nature of the intended change. 2. Update main branch In your local environment (e.g. your laptop), make sure you are on the main (prev. master ) branch and ensure that you have all the upstream changes, for example: git checkout master git pull 3. Create feature branch Create a new branch. Per convention, we try to use meaningful branch names such as: - issue23removeprocess (where issue 23 is the related issue on GitHub) - issue26addcontributor - release20210101 (for releases) On your command line, this looks like this: git checkout -b issue23removeprocess 4. Perform edit Using your editor of choice, perform the intended edit. For example: Protege Open src/ontology/upheno-edit.owl in Protege Make the change Save the file TextEdit Open src/ontology/upheno-edit.owl in TextEdit (or Sublime, Atom, Vim, Nano) Make the change Save the file Consider the following when making the edit. According to our development philosophy, the only places that should be manually edited are: src/ontology/upheno-edit.owl Any ROBOT templates you chose to use (the TSV files only) Any DOSDP data tables you chose to use (the TSV files, and potentially the associated patterns) components (anything in src/ontology/components ), see here . Imports should not be edited (any edits will be flushed out with the next update). However, refreshing imports is a potentially breaking change - and is discussed elsewhere . Changes should usually be small. Adding or changing 1 term is great. Adding or changing 10 related terms is ok. Adding or changing 100 or more terms at once should be considered very carefully. 4. Check the Git diff This step is very important. Rather than simply trusting your change had the intended effect, we should always use a git diff as a first pass for sanity checking. In our experience, having a visual git client like GitHub Desktop or sourcetree is really helpful for this part. In case you prefer the command line: git status git diff 5. Quality control Now its time to run your quality control checks. This can either happen locally ( 5a ) or through your continuous integration system ( 7/5b ). 5a. Local testing If you chose to run your test locally: sh run.sh make IMP=false test This will run the whole set of configured ODK tests on including your change. If you have a complex DOSDP pattern pipeline you may want to add PAT=false to skip the potentially lengthy process of rebuilding the patterns. sh run.sh make IMP=false PAT=false test 6. Pull request When you are happy with the changes, you commit your changes to your feature branch, push them upstream (to GitHub) and create a pull request. For example: git add NAMEOFCHANGEDFILES git commit -m \"Added biological process term #12\" git push -u origin issue23removeprocess Then you go to your project on GitHub, and create a new pull request from the branch, for example: https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pulls There is a lot of great advise on how to write pull requests, but at the very least you should: - mention the tickets affected: see #23 to link to a related ticket, or fixes #23 if, by merging this pull request, the ticket is fixed. Tickets in the latter case will be closed automatically by Github when the pull request is merged. - summarise the changes in a few sentences. Consider the reviewer: what would they want to know right away. - If the diff is large, provide instructions on how to review the pull request best (sometimes, there are many changed files, but only one important change). 7/5b. Continuous Integration Testing If you didn't run and local quality control checks (see 5a ), you should have Continuous Integration (CI) set up, for example: - Travis - GitHub Actions More on how to set this up here . Once the pull request is created, the CI will automatically trigger. If all is fine, it will show up green, otherwise red. 8. Community review Once all the automatic tests have passed, it is important to put a second set of eyes on the pull request. Ontologies are inherently social - as in that they represent some kind of community consensus on how a domain is organised conceptually. This seems high brow talk, but it is very important that as an ontology editor, you have your work validated by the community you are trying to serve (e.g. your colleagues, other contributors etc). In our experience, it is hard to get more than one review on a pull request - two is great. You can set up GitHub branch protection to actually require a review before a pull request can be merged! We recommend this. This step seems daunting to some hopefully under-resourced ontologies, but we recommend to put this high up on your list of priorities - train a colleague, reach out! 9. Merge and cleanup When the QC is green and the reviews are in (approvals), it is time to merge the pull request. After the pull request is merged, remember to delete the branch as well (this option will show up as a big button right after you have merged the pull request). If you have not done so, close all the associated tickets fixed by the pull request. 10. Changelog (Optional) It is sometimes difficult to keep track of changes made to an ontology. Some ontology teams opt to document changes in a changelog (simply a text file in your repository) so that when release day comes, you know everything you have changed. This is advisable at least for major changes (such as a new release system, a new pattern or template etc).","title":"Editors Workflow"},{"location":"howto/odk-workflows/EditorsWorkflow/#editors-workflow","text":"The editors workflow is one of the formal workflows to ensure that the ontology is developed correctly according to ontology engineering principles.

Review the release (Optional) Rough check. This step is frequently skipped, but for the more paranoid among us (like the author of this doc), this is a 3 minute additional effort for some peace of mind. Open the main release (ont.owl) in you favourite development environment (i.e. Protege) and eyeball the hierarchy. We recommend two simple checks: Does the very top level of the hierarchy look ok? This means that all new terms have been imported/updated correctly. Does at least one change that you know should be in this release appear? For example, a new class.

Once you have made your changes, you can run the following to apply your changes to the repository: sh run.sh make update_repo There are a large number of options that can be set to configure your ODK, but we will only discuss a few of them here. Managing imports You can use the update repository worflow described on this page to perform the following operations to your imports: Add a new import Modify an existing import Remove an import you no longer want Customise an import We will discuss all these workflows in the following. Add new import To add a new import, you first edit your odk config as described above , adding an id to the product list in the import_group section (for the sake of this example, we assume you already import RO, and your goal is to also import GO): import_group: products: - id: ro - id: go Note: our ODK file should only have one import_group which can contain multiple imports (in the products section). Next, you run the update repo workflow to apply these changes. Note that by default, this module is going to be a SLME Bottom module, see here . To change that or customise your module, see section \"Customise an import\". To finalise the addition of your import, perform the following steps: Add an imports statement to your src/ontology/upheno-edit.owl file.

If you are looking to customise imports, like changing the module type, see here . Importing a new term Importing a new term is split into to sub-phases: Declaring the terms to be imported Refreshing imports dynamically Declaring terms to be imported There are three ways to declare terms that are to be imported from an external ontology. Choose the appropriate one for your particular scenario (all three can be used in parallel if need be): Protege-based declaration Using term files Using the custom import template Protege-based declaration This workflow is to be avoided, but may be appropriate if the editor does not have access to the ODK docker container . Open your ontology (edit file) in Protege (5.5+). Select 'owl:Thing' Add a new class as usual. Paste the full iri in the 'Name:' field, for example, http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CHEBI_50906. Click 'OK' Now you can use this term for example to construct logical definitions. The next time the imports are refreshed (see how to refresh here ), the metadata (labels, definitions, etc) for this term are imported from the respective external source ontology and becomes visible in your ontology. Using term files Every import has, by default a term file associated with it, which can be found in the imports directory. For example, if you have a GO import in src/ontology/go_import.owl , you will also have an associated term file src/ontology/go_terms.txt . You can add terms in there simply as a list: GO:0008150 GO:0008151 Now you can run the refresh imports workflow ) and the two terms will be imported. Using the custom import template This workflow is appropriate if: You prefer to manage all your imported terms in a single file (rather than multiple files like in the \"Using term files\" workflow above). You wish to augment your imported ontologies with additional information. This requires a cautionary discussion. To enable this workflow, you add the following to your ODK config file ( src/ontology/upheno-odk.yaml ), and update the repository : use_custom_import_module: TRUE Now you can manage your imported terms directly in the custom external terms template, which is located at src/templates/external_import.owl . Note that this file is a ROBOT template , and can, in principle, be extended to include any axioms you like. Before extending the template, however, read the following carefully. The main purpose of the custom import template is to enable the management off all terms to be imported in a centralised place. To enable that, you do not have to do anything other than maintaining the template. So if you, say current import APOLLO_SV:00000480 , and you wish to import APOLLO_SV:00000532 , you simply add a row like this: ID Entity Type ID TYPE APOLLO_SV:00000480 owl:Class APOLLO_SV:00000532 owl:Class When the imports are refreshed see imports refresh workflow , the term(s) will simply be imported from the configured ontologies. Now, if you wish to extent the Makefile (which is beyond these instructions) and add, say, synonyms to the imported terms, you can do that, but you need to (a) preserve the ID and ENTITY columns and (b) ensure that the ROBOT template is valid otherwise, see here . WARNING . Note that doing this is a widespread antipattern (see related issue ). You should not change the axioms of terms that do not belong into your ontology unless necessary - such changes should always be pushed into the ontology where they belong. However, since people are doing it, whether the OBO Foundry likes it or not, at least using the custom imports module as described here localises the changes to a single simple template and ensures that none of the annotations added this way are merged into the base file .

Before diving into the logical issues it is worth examining patterns in existing phenotype ontologies to understand what user expectations may typically be for absence. Background * Absence_Phenotypes_in_OWL (Phenoscape Wiki) \\ * (outdated) material on the old PATO wiki . Details Strict logical absence vs absence of some It is not uncommon to see patterns such as From a strict logical perspective, this is inverted. \"absent incisors\" surely means \"absence of all incisors\", or put another way \"the animal has no incisors\". Yet it would be possible to have an animal with *absent* lower incisors and *present* upper incisors, yielding what seems a contradiction (because the subClass axiom would say this partial-incisor animal lacked all incisors). If the ontology were in fact truly modeling \"absence of *all* S\" then it would lead to a curious ontology structure, with the typical tree structure of the anatomy ontology representing S inverted into a polyhierarchical fan in the absent-S ontology. From this it can be cautiously inferred that the intent of the phenotype ontology curator and user is in fact to model \"absence of *some* S\" rather than \"absence of *all* S\". This is not necessarily a universal rule, and the intent may vary depending on whether we are talking about a serially repeated structure or one that typically occurs in isolation. The intent may also be to communicate that a *significant number* of S is missing. Absence as a type of morphology It is also not uncommon to see patterns such as: Again, from a strict logical perspective this is false. If the spleen is absent then what does the \"morphology\" of the parent refer to? However, this inference is clearly a desirable one from the point of view of the phenotype ontology editors and users, as it is common in ontologies for a variety of structures. For example: And: These patterns can be formally defended on developmental biology grounds. \"absence\" here is _not_ equivalent to logical absence. It refers specifically to developmental absence. Furthermore, strict logical absence leads to undesirable inferences. It would be odd to include a nematode worm as having the phenotype \"spleen absent\", because worms have not evolved spleens. But the logical description of not having a spleen as part fets a worm. Similarly, if the strict cardinality interpretation were intended, we would expect to see: i.e. if you're missing your entire hindlegs, you're *necessarily* missing your femurs. But it must be emphatisized that this is *not* how phenotype ontologies are classified. This goes for a wide range of structures and other relationship types. In MP, \"absent limb buds\" are *not* classified under \"absent limbs\", even though it is impossible for a mammal to have limbs without having had limb buds. Absence as part of a size-morphology spectrum The existing treatment of absence can be formally defended morphologically by conceiving of a morphological value space, with \"large\" at one end and \"small\" at the other. As we get continuously smaller, there may come an arbitrary point whereby we say \"surely this is no longer a limb\" (and of course, we are not talking about a pure geometrical size transformation here - as a limb reaches extreme edges of a size range various other morphological changes necessarily happen). But this cutoff is arguably arbitrary, and the resulting discontinuity causes problems. It is simpler to treat absence as being one end of a size scale. Summary This is barely touching the subject, and is intended to illustrate that things may be more subtle than naively treating words like \"absent\" as precisely equivalent to cardinality=0. An understanding of the medical, developmental and evolutionary contexts are absolutely required, together with an understanding of the entailments of different logical formulations. Even though existing phenotype ontologies may not be conceived of formally, it is implicit than they do not model absence as being equivalent to cardinality=0 / not(has_part), because the structure of these ontologies would look radically different.

For example: And: These patterns can be formally defended on developmental biology grounds. \"absence\" here is _not_ equivalent to logical absence. It refers specifically to developmental absence. Furthermore, strict logical absence leads to undesirable inferences. It would be odd to include a nematode worm as having the phenotype \"spleen absent\", because worms have not evolved spleens. But the logical description of not having a spleen as part fets a worm. Similarly, if the strict cardinality interpretation were intended, we would expect to see: i.e. if you're missing your entire hindlegs, you're *necessarily* missing your femurs. But it must be emphatisized that this is *not* how phenotype ontologies are classified. This goes for a wide range of structures and other relationship types. In MP, \"absent limb buds\" are *not* classified under \"absent limbs\", even though it is impossible for a mammal to have limbs without having had limb buds.","title":"Absence as a type of morphology"},{"location":"key-topics/modelling/absence/#absence-as-part-of-a-size-morphology-spectrum","text":"The existing treatment of absence can be formally defended morphologically by conceiving of a morphological value space, with \"large\" at one end and \"small\" at the other. As we get continuously smaller, there may come an arbitrary point whereby we say \"surely this is no longer a limb\" (and of course, we are not talking about a pure geometrical size transformation here - as a limb reaches extreme edges of a size range various other morphological changes necessarily happen). But this cutoff is arguably arbitrary, and the resulting discontinuity causes problems. It is simpler to treat absence as being one end of a size scale.","title":"Absence as part of a size-morphology spectrum"},{"location":"key-topics/modelling/absence/#summary","text":"This is barely touching the subject, and is intended to illustrate that things may be more subtle than naively treating words like \"absent\" as precisely equivalent to cardinality=0.

Even though existing phenotype ontologies may not be conceived of formally, it is implicit than they do not model absence as being equivalent to cardinality=0 / not(has_part), because the structure of these ontologies would look radically different.","title":"Summary"},{"location":"key-topics/modelling/absence/#todo","text":"Link to Jim Balhoff's PhenoDay paper and discussion Here's the link: http://phenoday2014.bio-lark.org/pdf/11.pdf","title":"TODO"},{"location":"key-topics/modelling/traits/","text":"","title":"Traits and phenotypes"},{"location":"key-topics/use-cases/cross_species_reasoning/","text":"Cross-species reasoning use cases Monarch ETC","title":"Cross-species reasoning"},{"location":"key-topics/use-cases/cross_species_reasoning/#cross-species-reasoning-use-cases","text":"Monarch ETC","title":"Cross-species reasoning use cases"},{"location":"reference/components/","text":"","title":"Overview"},{"location":"reference/imports/","text":"labels Featured Imported ontologies Introduction Imports directory: * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/upheno/imports/ Currently the imports includes: * imports/chebi_import.owl \\ * imports/doid_import.owl \\ * imports/go_import.owl \\ * imports/mpath_import.owl \\ * imports/pato_import.owl \\ * imports/pr_import.owl \\ * imports/uberon_import.owl \\ * imports/wbbt_import.owl Anatomy To avoid multiple duplicate classes for heart, lung, skin etc we map all classes to [Uberon] where this is applicable.
